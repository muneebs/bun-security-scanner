A [Bun security scanner](https://bun.com/docs/pm/security-scanner-api) that checks your dependencies against vulnerability databases before they get installed. Uses [Google's OSV database](https://osv.dev) by default — no API keys required.

- 🔍 **Automatic scanning**: runs transparently on every `bun install`
- ⚡ **Fast**: 24-hour per-package lockfile cache means repeat installs skip the network entirely
- 🔀 **Two backends**: OSV (free, no setup) or Snyk (commercial, broader coverage)
- 🔒 **Fail-open by default**: a downed API never blocks your install
- 🎯 **CVSS fallback**: uses score-based severity when a label isn't available
- 🛠️ **Configurable**: tune behaviour via environment variables

## 📦 Installation

```sh
bun add -d @nebzdev/bun-security-scanner
```

Then register it in your project's `bunfig.toml`:

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@nebzdev/bun-security-scanner"
```

That's it. The scanner runs automatically on the next `bun install`.

### Local development

Point `bunfig.toml` directly at the entry file using an absolute or relative path:

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "../bun-osv-scanner/src/index.ts"
```

---

## 🔀 Backends

The scanner ships with two backends, controlled by the `SCANNER_BACKEND` environment variable.

### OSV (default)

Queries [Google's OSV database](https://osv.dev) — free, no credentials required.

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@nebzdev/bun-security-scanner"
```

### Snyk

Queries [Snyk's vulnerability database](https://security.snyk.io) — commercial, often surfaces issues earlier. Requires a Snyk account.

```toml
# bunfig.toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@nebzdev/bun-security-scanner"
```

```sh
# .env
SCANNER_BACKEND=snyk
SNYK_TOKEN=your-token
SNYK_ORG_ID=your-org-id
```

## 🛡️ How it works

When `bun install` runs, Bun calls the scanner with the full list of packages to be installed. The scanner:

1. **Filters** non-resolvable versions — workspace, git, file, and path dependencies are skipped
2. **Checks the cache** — packages seen within the last 24 hours skip the network entirely
3. **Queries the backend** for any uncached packages
4. **Returns advisories** to Bun, which surfaces them as warnings or fatal errors

---

## ⚠️ Advisory levels

| Level | Trigger | Bun behaviour |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `fatal` | CRITICAL or HIGH severity; or CVSS score ≥ 7.0 | Installation halts |
| `warn` | MODERATE or LOW severity; or CVSS score < 7.0 | User is prompted; auto-cancelled in CI |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All options are set via environment variables — in your shell, or in a `.env` file at the project root (Bun loads it automatically).

### Shared

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SCANNER_BACKEND` | `osv` | Backend to use: `osv` or `snyk` |

### OSV backend

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OSV_FAIL_CLOSED` | `false` | Throw on network error instead of failing open |
| `OSV_NO_CACHE` | `false` | Always query OSV fresh, bypassing the local cache |
| `OSV_CACHE_FILE` | `.osv.lock` | Path to the cache file |
| `OSV_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds |
| `OSV_API_BASE` | `https://api.osv.dev/v1` | OSV API base URL |

### Snyk backend

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | — | **Required.** Snyk API token |
| `SNYK_ORG_ID` | — | **Required.** Snyk organization ID |
| `SNYK_FAIL_CLOSED` | `false` | Throw on network error instead of failing open |
| `SNYK_NO_CACHE` | `false` | Always query Snyk fresh, bypassing the local cache |
| `SNYK_CACHE_FILE` | `.snyk.lock` | Path to the cache file |
| `SNYK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds |
| `SNYK_RATE_LIMIT` | `160` | Max requests per minute (hard cap: 180) |
| `SNYK_CONCURRENCY` | `10` | Max concurrent connections |
| `SNYK_API_BASE` | `https://api.snyk.io/rest` | Regional endpoint override |
| `SNYK_API_VERSION` | `2024-04-29` | Snyk REST API version date |

### Fail-open vs fail-closed

By default the scanner **fails open**: if the backend is unreachable the scan is skipped and installation proceeds normally. Set `OSV_FAIL_CLOSED=true` or `SNYK_FAIL_CLOSED=true` to invert this.

```sh
# .env — strict mode
OSV_FAIL_CLOSED=true
```

---

## 🗄️ Cache

Results are cached per `package@version` in a lock file at the project root with a 24-hour TTL. Because a published package version is immutable, its vulnerability profile is stable within that window.

| Backend | Lock file |
|---------|-----------|
| OSV | `.osv.lock` |
| Snyk | `.snyk.lock` |

The files are designed to be **committed to git** — similar to a lockfile, committing them means your team and CI share the cache from day one without waiting for a warm-up scan.

```sh
git add .osv.lock   # or .snyk.lock
```

To force a fresh scan:

```sh
OSV_NO_CACHE=true bun install
# or
SNYK_NO_CACHE=true bun install
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/muneebs/bun-osv-scanner.git
cd bun-osv-scanner
bun install
```

### Commands

```sh
bun test              # Run all tests
bun run lint          # Lint source files
bun run format        # Check formatting
bun run format:write  # Auto-fix formatting
bun run check         # Lint + format check together
bun run check:write   # Lint + format, auto-fix what it can
```

### Backend comparison

| | OSV | Snyk |
|---|---|---|
| API key required | No | Yes |
| Batch endpoint | Yes (1000/req) | No (per-package, 180 req/min) |
| Coverage | Community feeds + GitHub Advisory | Snyk's proprietary database |
| Cache file | `.osv.lock` | `.snyk.lock` |

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only scans npm packages with concrete semver versions. `workspace:`, `file:`, `git:`, and range-only specifiers are skipped.
- OSV aggregates GitHub Advisory, NVD, and other feeds — coverage may lag slightly behind a vulnerability's public disclosure.
- The OSV batch API has a hard limit of 1,000 queries per request. Larger projects are split across multiple requests automatically.
- Snyk's per-package endpoint is rate-limited to 180 req/min. At that rate, a project with 2,000+ packages will take several minutes on the first scan.
