A [Bun security scanner](https://bun.sh/docs/install/security) that checks your dependencies against [Google's OSV database](https://osv.dev) before they get installed. No API keys. No external services to configure.

- 🔍 **Automatic scanning**: runs transparently on every `bun install`
- ⚡ **Fast**: 24-hour per-package cache means repeat installs skip the network entirely
- 📦 **No API keys**: OSV is a free, open vulnerability database
- 🔒 **Fail-open by default**: a downed API never blocks your install
- 🎯 **CVSS fallback**: uses score-based severity when a label isn't available
- 🛠️ **Configurable**: tune behaviour via environment variables

---

## 📦 Installation

```sh
bun add -d @bun-security-scanner/osv-os
```

Then register it in your project's `bunfig.toml`:

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@bun-security-scanner/osv-os"
```

That's it. The scanner runs automatically on the next `bun install`.

### Local development

Point `bunfig.toml` directly at the entry file using an absolute or relative path:

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "/absolute/path/to/bun-osv-scanner/src/index.ts"
```

Or relative to your project:

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "../bun-osv-scanner/src/index.ts"
```

For the Snyk scanner, swap the path:

```toml
[install.security]
scanner = "../bun-osv-scanner/src/snyk/index.ts"
```

---

## 🛡️ How it works

When `bun install` runs, Bun calls the scanner with the full list of packages to be installed. The scanner:

1. **Filters** non-resolvable versions — workspace, git, file, and path dependencies are skipped
2. **Checks the cache** — packages seen within the last 24 hours skip the network entirely
3. **Queries OSV** in batches of up to 1,000 packages per request via the [OSV batch API](https://google.github.io/osv.dev/post-v1-querybatch/)
4. **Fetches vulnerability details** in parallel for any hits
5. **Returns advisories** to Bun, which surfaces them as warnings or fatal errors

---

## ⚠️ Advisory levels

| Level | Trigger | Bun behaviour |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `fatal` | CRITICAL or HIGH severity; or CVSS score ≥ 7.0 | Installation halts |
| `warn` | MODERATE or LOW severity; or CVSS score < 7.0 | User is prompted; auto-cancelled in CI |

Severity is sourced from `database_specific.severity` on the OSV record. When that field is absent, the scanner falls back to the CVSS score. When neither is present, the advisory defaults to `warn`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All options are set via environment variables. They can be placed in your shell profile or scoped to a project via `bunfig.toml`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OSV_FAIL_CLOSED` | `false` | Throw on network error instead of failing open |
| `OSV_NO_CACHE` | `false` | Always query OSV fresh, bypassing the local cache |
| `OSV_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds |
| `OSV_API_BASE` | `https://api.osv.dev/v1` | OSV API base URL |

### Fail-open vs fail-closed

By default the scanner **fails open**: if OSV is unreachable the scan is skipped and installation proceeds normally. This prevents a downed API from blocking your team.

Set `OSV_FAIL_CLOSED=true` to invert this — any network failure cancels the install, ensuring packages are never installed without a successful scan. Recommended for security-sensitive projects.

```toml
# bunfig.toml — strict mode
[install.security]
scanner = "@bun-security-scanner/osv-os"

[install.env]
OSV_FAIL_CLOSED = "true"
OSV_TIMEOUT_MS = "5000"
```

---

## 🗄️ Cache

Results are cached per `package@version` at `~/.cache/bun-osv-scanner.json` with a 24-hour TTL. Because a published package version is immutable, its vulnerability profile is stable within that window.

To force a fresh scan, clear the cache:

```sh
rm ~/.cache/bun-osv-scanner.json
```

Or disable caching entirely for a single run:

```sh
OSV_NO_CACHE=true bun install
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/muneebs/bun-osv-scanner.git
cd bun-osv-scanner
bun install
```

### Commands

```sh
bun test              # Run all tests
bun run lint          # Lint source files
bun run format        # Check formatting
bun run format:write  # Auto-fix formatting
bun run check         # Lint + format check together
bun run check:write   # Lint + format, auto-fix what it can
```

## 🐛 Snyk scanner

A second scanner backed by [Snyk's vulnerability database](https://security.snyk.io) is available as an alternative. Snyk's database is commercial and often surfaces issues earlier than OSV.

### Setup

A Snyk account, API token, and org ID are required.

```toml
# bunfig.toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@bun-security-scanner/osv-os/snyk"

[install.env]
SNYK_TOKEN = "your-token"
SNYK_ORG_ID = "your-org-id"
```

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | — | **Required.** Snyk API token |
| `SNYK_ORG_ID` | — | **Required.** Snyk organization ID |
| `SNYK_FAIL_CLOSED` | `false` | Throw on network error instead of failing open |
| `SNYK_NO_CACHE` | `false` | Always query Snyk fresh, bypassing the local cache |
| `SNYK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds |
| `SNYK_CONCURRENCY` | `30` | Max parallel requests (hard cap: 180 to respect rate limit) |
| `SNYK_API_BASE` | `https://api.snyk.io/rest` | Regional endpoint override |
| `SNYK_API_VERSION` | `2024-04-29` | Snyk REST API version date |

### How it differs from OSV

| | OSV | Snyk |
|---|---|---|
| API key required | No | Yes |
| Batch endpoint | Yes (1000/req) | No (per-package, 180 req/min) |
| Coverage | Community feeds + GitHub Advisory | Snyk's proprietary database |
| Cache key prefix | `pkg@version` | `snyk:pkg@version` |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only scans npm packages with concrete semver versions. `workspace:`, `file:`, `git:`, and range-only specifiers are skipped.
- Vulnerability data is sourced from OSV, which aggregates GitHub Advisory, NVD, and other feeds. Coverage may lag slightly behind a vulnerability's public disclosure.
- The OSV batch API has a hard limit of 1,000 queries per request. Projects with more than 1,000 resolvable dependencies are split across multiple requests automatically.
